# Overview

The purpose of this project was to practioce Object oriented programming as well as learning more about built in libraries (Python arcade in this case.)

The goal of the game is to escape. You are a duck that has fallen into a well. (Upon future update) the well begins to fill with water so its a race against time and water.

# Future Work


* If you run the game you will notice the massive blue water at the bottom of the screen, the plan is to eventually get the water to move up slowly. It already interacts with the controllable sprite by starting over when the sprite comes in contact, I just need to make it move on its own.
* I need to add more levels once the player exits the well
* I plan on making the different types of platforms where some break after standing on them for a certain amount of time or ones that you can jump through the bottom but land on top.
